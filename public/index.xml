      <description>The object of this network is the propagation of open research practices through local activities. Effectively, an open research community is like a nucleation site around which the snowflake (or pearl, whatever analogy you prefer) of open research develops. This network is like a snow machine (I&amp;rsquo;ve gone mad on analogies but stay with me), optimising the conditions for open practices to develop in your local area.
To that end, this post intends to lay out how you can promote open research in your place of work and it borrows liberally from Loek Brinkman and Anita Eerland&amp;rsquo;s guide to forming the original Open science Community Utrecht.</description>

      <description>Test Open Research Community Test University is a Place. The open research community at Test is primarily located at the test campus and is eager to know open research advocates in the local area.
We will be running a weekly &amp;ldquo;open science hacky hour&amp;rdquo; on the test campus, so if you want to learn more about open research, find new ways to open up your work, or just want to meet some new people, let us know and come along.</description>
